Accidentally found this really old code I wrote ages ago for implementing the Tic-Tac-Toe game with terminal-based UI. I am just going to keep it on GitHub as a part of my path to becoming a developer! Who knows, one day I will probably do a huge refactoring of this code and add a better UI! XD

Please, download [.rar](https://github.com/artem-tkachuk/tic-tac-toe/blob/master/main.rar) file and unzip it to be able to play!
